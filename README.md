# 🚨 CrisisReport – Crowdsourced Disaster Reporting Platform

CrisisReport is a responsive, full-stack web application designed to empower communities during emergencies. It enables users to report disasters in real time, access live feeds, donate to verified causes, get essential resources, and contact emergency services — all in one unified platform.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

This project is built using **React.js** on the frontend. It follows a modular and scalable architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend. It’s ideal for students, contributors, and developers who want to build socially impactful applications.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CrisisReport.git
cd CrisisReport
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application in Development Mode

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app on:
👉 `http://localhost:3000`

The app supports hot reloading, so any changes you make will reflect instantly in your browser.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

To start the test runner in interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```

You can write unit and component tests to ensure the app behaves as expected.

---

## ⚙️ Building for Production

To create an optimized and minified production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build/` folder with all assets optimized and hashed, ready for deployment.

---

## 🚨 Ejecting (Advanced Use Only)

```bash
npm run eject
```

> ⚠️ This is a permanent operation. Ejecting gives you full control over the configuration but removes the simplicity of Create React App. Proceed only if you need deep customization (e.g., modifying webpack, Babel, etc.).

Let me know:
- If you want to include backend details (if any),
- If your images are in a subfolder like `./assets/`,
- Or if you'd like this exported as a **README.pdf** too!

I'll update it accordingly.
